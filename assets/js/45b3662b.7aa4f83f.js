You will notice some Jinja code in this fiile. Jinja is a web template engine for Python and allows you to do for loops, like in this example, which is helpful to shorten repetitive code that can take up several lines in your code base - pretty powerful stuff! Alieu will go more in depth on Jinja in a later session!"))),(0,i.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},'Do "Select Top 1000" on the ',(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"customers")," and ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"orders")," tables in Azure Data Studio or SSMS under ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Tables")," and take a look at these tables."),(0,i.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Note: If you're wondering what dictates whether a dbt model gets turned into a table or view, check out ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"em"},"dbt_project.yml"),".
