# Workflows

## main.yml (Build & Deployment Pipeline)

This pipeline is based on the Docusaurus 2 [Github Actions deployment documentation.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#triggering-deployment-with-github-actions) 

The only significant difference is this Action has been configured to build and deploy on updates to the `main` branch. Additionally an ssh key has been generated and configured in dbt-msft secrets and this projects deploy keys leveraging a private account.

### checks

Install npm dependencies and run a test build. Docusaurus will throw an error if any dead links or major errors are found in `docusaurus.config.js`.

### gh-release

Docusaurus uses build in build task to push built files into the `gh-pages` branch of this repo. The Github Pages site is hosted from this branch. As mentioned above the authentication used via an SSH token generated by [timdenouden](https://github.com/timdenouden).
